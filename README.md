# E-Commerce-Website_Project
I developed a fully functional clone of the Amazon website, with a focus on replicating key features such as user registration, product listing, shopping cart functionality, and secure checkout. Additionally, I implemented a responsive design to ensure optimal user experience across all devices. Technologies Used: HTML and CSS.
